## GiveWP Crowdfund Extension

Currently, GiveWP does not support or allow users to submit their personal campaigns. We need a custom add-on to GiveWP that would allow.

- Users to be able to submit their personal campaign/cause for approval. Upon approval by the site administrator, then their campaign is live to receive donations.
- Admin will review and approve the newly submitted campaign before the campaign can go live.
- Admin can also suspend campaigns, and review donations collected for each campaign or donations collected for all campaigns.

## FundRaiser Process
### Plugin Objectives
- Allow users (individuals) to submit personal campaigns using GiveWP. 
- Supports login, registration, new campaign submission, and campaign management through the frontend dashboard. 
- This extension must support GiveWP.
- New submitted campaign will require Administrator approval before User can publish (live) it.
- New campaign verification
- Administrator needs to verify if the information submitted by the user (fundraiser) is genuine. 
- This is done manually through phone/email. 
- Once information is verified as genuine, administrator will approve the campaign.
- Approved campaign
- Once campaign is approved, user can update more information or publish (live) it.
